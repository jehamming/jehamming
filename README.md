- 👋 Hi, I’m @jehamming
- 👀 I’m interested in Boardgames and hobby software engineering and Agile
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on one of my pet projects: STORIM. I am a infrastructure kind of guy, so GUIs are not my thing. 
- 📫 How to reach me: find me on LinkedIn/Twitter whatever. 

This space holds my pet projects, especically STORIM, a new kind of Server (+Client) system for Story based Instant Messaging, replacing Whatsapp etc with a new kind of 
app  : Whatsapp combined with LambdaMoo  - ish
